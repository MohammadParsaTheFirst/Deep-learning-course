    "Welcome! In this assignment, you’ll build an application that converts informal Persian sentences to formal ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pre‑process** the *ParsMap* informal–formal corpus with the `hazm` library.  \n",
    "2. **Compute** input/output *token‑length statistics* to choose sensible `max_length` values.  \n",
    "3. **Fine‑tune** the multilingual T5‑base model (`google/mt5-base`) using **Low‑Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**.  \n",
    "4. **Evaluate** your model with BLEU and **perplexity**.  \n",
    "5. **Explore** *stochastic decoding* strategies (temperature, top‑k, nucleus) and discuss diversity vs. quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fill in each **`TODO`** region with code or text.  \n",
    "When you finish, submit the completed notebook with a brief discussion section at the end summarising your findings."
